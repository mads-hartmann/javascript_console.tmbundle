	 Hey there fellow JavaScript lover - I assume you've got a soft spot
	 for the JavaScript, otherwise what use would a console be to you?

	 This was primarily built out of a demo I wrote for my upcoming book
	 introducinghtml5.com as a way to introspect what was going on inside
	 a web worker, since the environment is sandboxed. Then I realised, 
	 I need a sandbox environment/console that I could increase the font
	 size - and having seen something similar-ish by @thomasfuchs, I went
	 about tweaking my worker demo to this. About 3 hours work one late
	 Sunday afternoon.

	 The way this works, is I generate an iframe on the fly, an run the
	 commands through an eval *inside* the iframe, so it's a fairly good
	 enviroment to run tests. Then I've got a custom stringify function
	 because JSON.stringify doesn't decode native DOM objects, like the
	 DOMWindow object. 

	 There's more I want to do with this, so watch the github account
	 or even contribute: http://github.com/remy/console

	 Otherwise, hope you enjoy this app. Any questions or issues, drop
	 me a message on github or Twitter: twitter.com/rem

	 - Cheers, @rem
